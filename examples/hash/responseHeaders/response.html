		    // response by the server.
		    // Following sequence will be followed.
		    // 1. User will send the first request to the web server for detection.
		    // 2. Web Server will return the properties in response based on the headers sent in the request. Along 
		    // with the properties, it will also send a new header field Accept-CH in response indicating the additional
		    // evidence it needs. It builds the new response header using SetHeader[Component name]Accept-CH properties 
		    // where Component Name is the name of the component for which properties are required.
		    // 3. When 'Use User Agent Client Hints' button will be clicked, device detection request will again 
		    // be sent to the server with all additional client hints that was requested in the previous
		    // response by the server.
		    // 4. Web Server will return the properties based on the new User Agent Client Hint headers 
		    // being used as evidence.
